# Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion with TensorFlow
This repository contains a machine learning project developed in a Jupyter Notebook that uses TensorFlow to build a simple model capable of converting temperatures form Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how a machine learning model can learn complex relationships from training data, in this case, a series of temperature conversion examples.

## Project Objectives
- Basic use of TensorFlow and Keras
- Understanding Machine Learning
- Data and results visualization

## Repository Contents
- A data file containing examples of temperatures in Celsius and their corresponding conversion in Fahrenheit
- A Jupyter Notebook that includes all the code, from data loading to model evaluation

## How to use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook and run the .ipynb file
4. You can run the Notebook cell by cell to see how the model trains ands makes predictions.

This project is ideal for those who are just starting with TensorFlow and want to see a practical and simple application of machine learning
